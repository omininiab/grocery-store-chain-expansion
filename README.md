A grocery store chain, with 85 stores, is planning a significant expansion, introducing 10 new stores at the beginning of the new year. I used multiple analytical (predictive) techniques to provide recommendations on where and how to expand. Furthermore, since products in the fresh produce category have short life spans, leading to increasing costs, I provided accurate monthly sales forecast for all stores (new and existing) for the new year.

Data available includes:

[Store Sales Data](https://github.com/omininiab/grocery-store-chain-expansion/blob/master/storesalesdata%20(1).csv) - This file contains sales by product category for all existing stores for 2012, 2013, and 2014.

[Store Information](https://github.com/omininiab/grocery-store-chain-expansion/blob/master/storeinformation%20(1).csv) - This file contains location data for each of the stores.

[Store Demographic Data](https://github.com/omininiab/grocery-store-chain-expansion/blob/master/storedemographicdata%20(3).csv) - This file contains demographic data for the areas surrounding each of the existing stores and locations for new stores.

Tools used: Alteryx and Tabelau
